# dijo

This is my digital journal setup.

This was inspired by Bullet Journal, enabled by GoodNotes on iOS and the Apple
Pencil.

These may work in other formats for you.

# how to use it


## todos

Throughout the day, you do one of four actions to your tasks.

![dijo actions](https://github.com/nod/dijo/raw/master/media/actions.png)

- `done` a task by coloring in a task bubbles
- `wait` on a task when blocked by others with a little `w` in the bubble
- `nope` a task by just drawing a line through the whole thing
- `push` a task at the end of the day unless it's done or noped.  Waiting stuff
  gets pushed also


## timebox

Draw a bracket to show that time is occupied.  Some find it
helpful to write the starting time to the left.  Then mark out how that time was
used. It also may do to block out time in a diff color that was unplanned or
"stolen" as a way of indicating a divergence from your planned day.  It's not a
negative thing, just an answer to "Why didn't I finish X?  Oh yeah"

## notes

The bottom half of the page is made for scribbling.  Take notes for meetings
that happened that day, or mark down other items that happened of interest.
