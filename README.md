This is my digital journal setup.

This was inspired by Bullet Journal, enabled by GoodNotes on iOS and the Apple
Pencil.


These may work in other formats for you.

## use with goodnotes

Easiest way is to download a release zip file and open it into your icloud drive
folder.

Then in Goodnotes, go to `Options - Template Library - +`.

From there Go to `Custon - Edit` and then select the pdf files to add from your
iCloud Drive.
