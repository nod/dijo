# dijo

This is my digital journal setup.

This was inspired by Bullet Journal, enabled by GoodNotes on iOS and the Apple
Pencil.

These may work in other formats for you.

# how to use it


## todos

Write tasks in the todo box.  Different colors or highlighted may work to
indicate priority.

Throughout the day, you do one of four actions to your tasks.

![dijo actions](https://github.com/nod/dijo/raw/master/media/actions.png)

- `done` - complete a task by coloring in the task bubble
- `push` - at the end of the day any open or waiting task gets pushed to the
  next day.  Copy those to your next page.
- `nope` - never going to do a task? nope it by drawing a line through the
  whole thing and moving on with your life
- `wait` - when a task is blocked (for whatever reason) write a little `w` in
  the bubble and maybe a note indicating why you're waiting


## timebox

Draw a bracket to show a time block is occupied.

Some find it helpful to write the starting time to the left.

In that block, mark how that time was used.

For unplanned time, mark a time block in a diff color.  This indicates the time
was a divergence from your planned day.  It's not a negative thing, just an
answer to "Why didn't I finish X?  Oh yeah"

## notes

The bottom half of the page is made for scribbling.  Take notes for meetings
that happened that day, or mark down other items that happened of interest.


# how to load into goodnotes

Easiest way is to [download a release zip file](https://github.com/nod/dijo/archive/initial.zip) and open it into your icloud drive folder.

Then in Goodnotes, go to `Options - Template Library - +`.

From there Go to `Custon - Edit` and then select the pdf files to add from your
